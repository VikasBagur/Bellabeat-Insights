**Data:**
**Data used:**
We are using data from Fitbit fitness tracker whose functionality is similar to Bellabeat Ivy.

**Description:**
The data was recorded by various activity tracking devices made from Fitbit and the datasets were created from the responses received through a survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 04.12.2016-05.12.2016 from users who use the tracking devices. The collected data includes per minute, per hour and per day measures of activity performed, calories burnt, steps walked, sleep and a weight log to see the progress of weight goals. The data from each criteria mentioned before are captured as separate dataset.

**Credibility:**
There are 2 entities whose credibility we need to check: Fitbit and Mobius

	Fitbit: Fitbit is one of the top wearable fitness tracking company and they have been in this field since 2007. In the year 2016 when this dataset was created, Fitbit was awarded "Innovation honoree" and "Best in the health and Wellness category" at CES, which is an annual trade show organized by the Consumer Technology Association. In a study conducted by National Center for Biotechnology Information in 2016, Fitbit came out as the second most accurate fitness tracker[1]. Due to these statements, we can safely assume that the data recorded by Fitbit is accurate and reliable. Since the data is measured and recorded by the devices they manufacture, it is safe to say that the data is original.

	Mobius is an user of Kaggle. Kaggle has a progressive performance tiers of Novice, Contributor, Expert, Master and Grandmaster in four categories: Competitions, Notebooks, Datasets, and Discussion. Mobius has a rank of Master in competitions and Expert in the rest. He also works as a data scientist in the healthcare field.
	
Combining the credibility of both the entities, we can say that the datasets are reliable and credible. But use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors/preference could have led to variation between output.
