# Bellabeat-Insights

**Business task:**
Analyze usage data from non-Bellabeat smart device in order to gain insights and use them to recommend marketing strategy for the growth of Bellabeat Ivy.

**Key stakeholders:**
		a. Urška Sršen, Cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat
		b. Sando Mur, Mathematician and cofounder of Bellabeat
		c. The rest of the Bellabeat marketing analytics team



**Data:**
**Data used:**
We are using data from Fitbit fitness tracker whose functionality is similar to Bellabeat Ivy.

**Description:**
The data was recorded by various activity tracking devices made from Fitbit and the datasets were created from the responses received through a survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 04.12.2016-05.12.2016 from users who use the tracking devices. The collected data includes per minute, per hour and per day measures of activity performed, calories burnt, steps walked, sleep and a weight log to see the progress of weight goals. The data from each criteria mentioned before are captured as separate dataset.

**Credibility:**
There are 2 entities whose credibility we need to check: Fitbit and Mobius

1. Fitbit: Fitbit is one of the top wearable fitness tracking company and they have been in this field since 2007. In the year 2016 when this dataset was created, Fitbit 	was awarded "Innovation honoree" and "Best in the health and Wellness category" at CES, which is an annual trade show organized by the Consumer Technology Association. 	In a study conducted by National Center for Biotechnology Information in 2016, Fitbit came out as the second most accurate fitness tracker[1]. Due to these statements, 	we can safely assume that the data recorded by Fitbit is accurate and reliable. Since the data is measured and recorded by the devices they manufacture, it is safe to 		say that the data is original.

2. Mobius is an user of Kaggle. Kaggle has a progressive performance tiers of Novice, Contributor, Expert, Master and Grandmaster in four categories: Competitions, 		Notebooks, Datasets, and Discussion. Mobius has a rank of Master in competitions and Expert in the rest. He also works as a data scientist in the healthcare field.
	
Combining the credibility of both the entities, we can say that the datasets are reliable and credible. But use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors/preference could have led to variation between output. 

**Insights:**
1. Calories burnt:

	a. For the duration for which we have the data, we can see that the users have spent most calories from 9 am to 7 pm, with the calories burnt increasing towards the end. 	  We can assume that this is because everyone goes to work during the day and exercise during the evening time. We can use this data to suggest a reminder for new users to 	    start working out anytime from 5 pm to 7 pm till they set their own. 
	
	b. In order to maintain energy and have a healthy body, it is recommended that people drink 2.7 to 3.7 liters of water depending on their gender. When we burn calories, 	 we lose water when we burn calories and since most of the calories burnt is during the daytime and the intensity of the activity is also high along with high step               counts, we can send a reminder to users to stay hydrated.
	
2. BMI > 25:

	a. Whenever we see ads for wearable activity trackers, we see fit, lean or muscular people wearing them to track their activities, we never see unfit and fat people 		wearing them to track their fitness progress. Because of such ads, unfit people might not be motivated to buy the trackers as they might feel they don't deserve it. But 	according to our data 62.5% of our users have a BMI greater than 25, which includes overweight and obese people. We can use this insight to motivate more people to get 	fit and use our trackers for logging their progress.
	
3. 7 hours of sleep:

	a. According to CDC, an adult (18-60 years) should sleep for 7 or more hours every night. But, when we look at our data, for the duration of data collected, 75% of our 	users sleep on an average of less than 7 hours every night. We can create awareness of the importance of sleep and notify our users to get more sleep.
